<i>Hat tip to my friend James Watters (<a href="https://twitter.com/wattersjames">@wattersjames</a>) for teaching me about the value line.</i><br /><br />
What is the value line? The value line is how you distinguish whatâ€™s core to your business vs what you can and should outsource. In todayâ€™s world 
we outsource a lot of things as non-core concerns but somehow continue to blur the line when it comes to Dev and Ops.</p>
