Last time we talked to you about how we believe Micro is [Netlify for the backend]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/11/12/netlify-for-the-frontend-micro-for-the-backend.html). 
We got a very strong positive reaction to that, filling a pain point it looks like many people had. In that post we used headless cms aka blog posts 
as an example of the API you'd build on the backend to be consumed by a frontend. Today we're going to take it a step further.

An API on its own isn't enough. There's no content. You have to populate it yourself. So what if we made it just a little bit easier. How about we help
 you turn any blog, any content with an rss feed into an easy to consume API with just a handful of commands. Exciting right, let's get to it.
