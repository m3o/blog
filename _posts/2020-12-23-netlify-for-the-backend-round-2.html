A while back we talked about a new architecture pattern, [Netlify for the frontend, Micro for the backend]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/11/12/netlify-for-the-frontend-micro-for-the-backend.html). 
As the frontend has evolved towards being dominated by the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), we believe the backend also requires a fundamental shift in it's design and consumption model. 

Netlify, while largely agnostic of framework usage, has promoted decomposition of the traditional stack to something more driven by microservices and APis on the backend. 
[Micro](https://m3o.com) has long been an advocate for that, both as an [open source](https://github.com/micro/micro) project and now has a hosted platform called 
[M3O](https://m3o.com).
